        "Q1) What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing code that's organized around objects and classes, rather than just functions and procedures.OOP helps developers create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2) What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Ans: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is like a blueprint or a template that defines the characteristics and behaviors of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3) What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans: In OOP, the car is an object, and it's an instance of the \"Car\" class. The class provides the blueprint or template for creating objects, and the object represents a specific instance of that class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4) What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans: Abstraction is the process of showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, making it harder for other parts of the program to access or modify the data directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5) What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, dunder methods (short for \"double underscore\" methods) are special methods that are surrounded by double underscores (__) on either side of the method name. These methods are also known as magic methods or special methods, and they're used to emulate the behavior of built-in types in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6) Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Ans: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class to inherit the properties and behavior of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7) What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "8) How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of classes and objects, along with access modifiers. for Ex"

        "Q8) What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, a constructor is a special method that's automatically called when an object is created from a class. It's used to initialize the attributes of the class and set up the object's internal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9) What is a constructor in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "Q10) What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans: A static method is a method that's not bound to the class or instance. It's a method that's essentially a function, but defined inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11) What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, method overloading is a feature that allows multiple methods with the same name to be defined, but with different parameter lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12) What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Ans: In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method overriding is a technique where a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that's already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "13) What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, a property decorator is a special type of decorator that allows you to customize access to instance variables. It's a way to implement getters, setters, and deleters for your object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14) Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This enables more flexibility, generic code, and easier maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "15) What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be inherited by other classes. Abstract classes provide a way to define a blueprint for other classes to follow, while also allowing for customization and extension.\n",
        "\n",
        "16) What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Ans: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides several advantages like Modularity, Reusability, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism and many more\n",
        "\n",
        "17) What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Ans: A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. It is defined inside the class definition, but outside any instance method. Over that An instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class. It is defined inside an instance method, typically in the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "18) What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, multiple inheritance is a feature that allows a class to inherit properties and behavior from more than one parent class. This means that a child class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19) Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans: The __str__ method has Its primary purpose is to provide a concise and informative string that summarizes the object's essential information. The __repr__ method has Its primary purpose is to provide a detailed and unambiguous string that accurately represents the object's state.\n",
        "\n",
        "20) What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, the super() function is used to access the methods and properties of a parent class from a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21) What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, the __del__ method is a special method that's called when an object is want to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22) What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Ans: A @staticmethod is a method that belongs to a class, rather than an instance of the class. It's essentially a function that's defined inside a class, but it doesn't have access to the class or instance variables. over that A @classmethod is a method that's bound to the class, rather than an instance of the class. It's a method that's called on the class itself, but it has access to the class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "23) How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. With inheritance, polymorphism enables to write code that can work with different classes without knowing their specific details.\n",
        "\n",
        "24)What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Ans: In Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), method chaining is a technique where multiple methods are called on an object in a single statement, with each method returning the object itself. This allows to perform a series of operations on an object in a concise and readable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "25) What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans: In Python, the __call__ method is a special method that allows an object to be called as a function. This method is also known as the callable method."
